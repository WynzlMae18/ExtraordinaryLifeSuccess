            <p>We are all born with the magnificent, marvellous, magic gift of intuition, you may know it as your gut feeling, inner voice, sixth sense, I refer to mine as my soul whispers. I am Louise Budgen, an accredited coach and I help women get connected to their soul whispers, post life challenging experiences, re-energise their emotional, physical and spiritual wellness, create a new vision and a personal powerful sustainable action plan to supercharge their life from ordinary to EXTRAORDINARY.</p>
            <p>I am on a mission to get women to celebrate their uniqueness and brilliance, not just occasionally but every day and showing up as their best soul self. I saved my life three times by listening to my soul whispers and these life challenging experiences have literally thrown me onto a path I hadn’t ever expected to travel!</p>
            <img src="img/LouiseBudgen_0241.jpg" alt="Content Image 2" class="content-img">
            <p>My own EXTRAORDINARY life has unfolded in such a magical way and I will be forever grateful to these challenges and my soul whispers for guiding me to explore, embrace, express my EXTRA and now be able to live my truth and help other women do the same.</p>
            <p>I developed my signature programme The EXTRAORDINARY Life Success System as I realised the tools I had used so successfully to optimise my own emotional, physical and spiritual wellness needed to be shared. I live each day now feeling fulfilled, energised, connected and happy, I want the same for you!</p>
            <img src="img/LouiseBudgen_0149.jpg" alt="Content Image 3" class="content-img3">
            <p>I designed my signature programme for women who have had stressful life challenging experiences, cancer, illnesses, accidents, divorce, redundancy …..and are now ready to move on. Do you?</p>
